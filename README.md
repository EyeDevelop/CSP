# Collection of assignments for Computer Science.


### Prerequisites
* Python3.7+
* Python pip

### How to install
All you have to do is install the requirements via pip. The requirement is needed for the
password vault application only, so this step can be skipped for the two games in this
repo.

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or with pip installed in PATH:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to run
There are a few different applications in this repo. There are two games,
Tic Tac Toe and Rock Paper Scissors that can be executed without even installing the requirements.
The third and final program, the Password Vault, needs the requirement however.
After installing it can be run without hassle.


### What applications are there?
##### Tic Tac Toe.

A variation on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. This version, however, has support for
more players than 2, and can also be played on a larger board. There is no 3x3
square to limit you anymore. Just start the game and have fun.

    

##### Rock Paper Scissors.

This is the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors everybody knows and loves. The game is played
with two players and only has the options of Rock, Paper and Scissors. When a timely
classic is this good, there's nothing to be changed.


##### The Vault

The Vault is a password manager. It requires the requirements to be installed and can
then be used for all your password needs. Security is ensured, as The Vault cannot
be breached without the master password. Not without a Quantum Computer at least.
The Vault also has an option to generate a password for you, based on your preferences
and specifications.
